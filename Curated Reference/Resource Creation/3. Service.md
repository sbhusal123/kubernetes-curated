# Kubernetes Service 
Allows Exposing a group of pods within a Cluster, Node, External Service or Any other service:

Syntatic Sugar:

Here, in all the yaml configuration the common thing is:

```yaml
apiVersion: ...
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: ...
spec:
  selector:
    app: my-app 
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80  # Port that the service will listen on
      targetPort: 8080  # Port that the pod will listen on
  type: ...
```
Basically what the above definition does is, it creates a ``type`` (Cluster, Node, ...) of service and 
redirects the request on incoming ``port: 80`` of ``protocol: TCP`` to the group of pods with label ``app: my-app`` listening on ``targetPort: 8080``

## 1. ClusterIP Service

This is the most common type of service and exposes the service internally.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: my-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: my-app  # Select pods with the label app=my-app
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80  # Port that the service will listen on
      targetPort: 8080  # Port that the pod will listen on
  clusterIP: None  # Optional: For headless service (without load balancer)
```

## 2. NodePort

Exposes the service on a static port on all nodes in the cluster. This type of service is useful for accessing applications from outside the cluster.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: my-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: my-app
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80  # Port the service listens on inside the cluster
      targetPort: 8080  # Port the pod listens on
      nodePort: 30007  # Static port exposed on each node
  type: NodePort  # Specifies the type as NodePort
```

## 3. LoadBalancer Service

If you're using a cloud provider (AWS, GCP, etc.) that supports external load balancers, Kubernetes can provision an external load balancer to expose the service.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: my-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: my-app
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80  # Port the service listens on inside the cluster
      targetPort: 8080  # Port the pod listens on
  type: LoadBalancer  # Specifies the type as LoadBalancer
```

## 4. External Service

This type of service maps to an external DNS name (e.g., for an external database or service).

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: my-service
spec:
  type: ExternalName
  externalName: my-database.example.com  # External DNS name to map the service to
```
