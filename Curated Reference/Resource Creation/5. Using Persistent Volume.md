# Using Volumes in Kubernetes

- We'll be using a mount path from the device and mount it into the pod.

## 1. Define a PersistentVolume Resource:

A Persistent Volume represents a piece of storage in the cluster, provisioned by an administrator. It defines where and how much storage is available.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1  # Specifies Kubernetes API version.
kind: PersistentVolume  # Defines the resource type as a Persistent Volume (PV).
metadata:
  name: local-pv  # Unique name of the Persistent Volume.
spec:
  capacity:
    storage: 1Gi  # Defines the total storage capacity of the PV.
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce  # Defines how the volume can be accessed (explained below).
  persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy: Retain  # Defines what happens to the PV after PVC is deleted.
  storageClassName: local-storage  # Assigns a storage class for dynamic provisioning.
  hostPath:
    path: "/mnt/data"  # Specifies the directory on the host node where data is stored.
```

**Keyword	Purpose:**
- ``apiVersion: v1``	Specifies the API version of Kubernetes used for the PV.
- ``kind: PersistentVolume``	Declares that this YAML is creating a Persistent Volume.
- ``metadata.name``	Assigns a unique name to the PV (local-pv).
- ``spec.capacity.storage``	Defines the size of the storage (e.g., 1Gi).
- ``spec.accessModes``	Specifies how the volume can be accessed. Possible values:
    - ``ReadWriteOnce`` → Mounted as read-write by a single node.
    - ``ReadOnlyMany`` → Mounted as read-only by multiple nodes.
    - ``ReadWriteMany`` → Mounted as read-write by multiple nodes.
- ``spec.persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy``	Defines what happens after PVC is deleted:
    - ``Retain`` → Data remains after PVC is deleted.
    - ``Recycle`` → Performs basic cleanup before reuse.
    - ``Delete`` → Deletes the storage resource.
- ``spec.storageClassName``	Associates the PV with a Storage Class (local-storage).
- ``spec.hostPath.path``	Specifies the directory path on the host machine where storage is kept.

  ## 2. Define a PersistentVolumeClaim

  A PVC is a request for storage that binds to an available PV that matches its requirements.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1  # Specifies Kubernetes API version.
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim  # Defines the resource type as a Persistent Volume Claim (PVC).
metadata:
  name: local-pvc  # Unique name of the PVC.
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce  # Defines the access mode requested for storage.
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 500Mi  # Specifies the storage amount requested.
  storageClassName: local-storage  # Should match the storage class of the PV.
```

**Keyword	Purpose:**
- ``apiVersion: v1``	Specifies the Kubernetes API version used for PVC.
- ``kind: PersistentVolumeClaim``	Declares that this YAML is creating a PVC.
- ``metadata.name``	Assigns a unique name to the PVC (local-pvc).
- ``spec.accessModes``	Defines the access mode requested for the volume (same options as PV).
- ``spec.resources.requests.storage``	Requests a specific amount of storage (500Mi).
- ``spec.storageClassName``	Matches the storage class of the PV to bind them.

## 3. Using it With Deployment:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: my-app
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: my-app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: my-app
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: my-container
          image: busybox
          command: [ "sh", "-c", "sleep 3600" ]
          volumeMounts:
            - mountPath: "/data"  # Directory inside the container
              name: storage
      volumes:
        - name: storage
          persistentVolumeClaim:
            claimName: local-pvc  # Must match the PVC name.
```

Notice the section:
```yaml
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: my-container
          image: busybox
          command: [ "sh", "-c", "sleep 3600" ]
          volumeMounts:
            - mountPath: "/data"  # Directory inside the container
              name: storage
      volumes:
        - name: storage
          persistentVolumeClaim:
            claimName: local-pvc  # Must match the PVC name.
```

We have ``volume`` section defined in the spec, and ``volumeMount`` defined in the containers section.
